// string construction for communication; also for parsing to commands
// command handler
// motor switch on and off isolation and its own object - motor abstraction and encapsulation: with delay timeouts
// Loop protocol simplification - easy to read: handle timer events separately/in their own loops



// Flow control object
// Construct with a pwm pin parameter
// Each such object has a timeout optional switch on and a switch off
// private methods to switch on and off, and a state variable that maintains the current state of the flow

// Turbidostat objects
// Has inflow, outflow, OD, setpoint, status
// 


// General timeout object that calls other things in the absence of any object
