Code for five parallely running turbidostats

* Five loops running one after another - in a simplified single loop and yet not being hard to debug
* Communication and control that is centralised
* Sensing and logging needs to be centralised...?
* Health signal that tells the state periodically every few minutes; also support for refresh.
* 




UI for turbidostats
* Multiple tabs - and with each showing corresponding OD as well - as it changes
* Each of them periodically queried. Also with a refresh button
